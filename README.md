## Assumptions

Although this is a web application, it is oriented and optimized for mobile devices since they are used more frequently to access the internet in people's daily lives, than for example a personal computer

Two approaches were used, both do the same, but the first one uses a a Restful API using Django REST Framework over an SQL scheme and second one uses a GRAPHQL scheme, first one can be accessed from base url http://localhost:8000 and the second one from http://localhost:8000/graphql-mode/

## Technologies used

1. Django
2. React Js Framework
